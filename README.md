# Lightricks DataHack 2018 Challenge

Want to help a succesful Jerusalem startup pilot its churn prediction task for its flagship app?

Lightricks, the Jerusalem-based company behind popular, award-winning image and video
editing apps, invites **you** on board at DataHack. Sift through our application usage data to solve a pressing
business challenge for Facetune 2 (the hit selfie editor downloaded by millions of users
worldwide). 

With help from Lighricks mentors, search through the noisy data, consisting of tens of
thousands of users’ usage-records, to discover patterns that can predict who are the minority users who are going to churn!

The prize… a real-world, complex mission you can get your teeth into (with some sequence / time-series modeling), and a
lucrative cash reward too!

# How to submit your team's churn predictions
To submit your churn predictions on the test data for grading and listing in the leaderboard (automatically updated based on incoming submissions), please mail the output of your model (see [notebook](datahack_2018.ipynb) for example of how to create one) to **datahack@lightricks.com**. Please put your team's name in the Subject line.  

# Judging criteria for submissions
We will rank submissions qualitatively by the [F-1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score), the harmonic mean of precision and recall, with respect to the positive class (the users who churned) only (in other words, precision and recall with respect to the non-churning users is not part of the score). The F-1 score, as well as precision and recall, will appear in the [leaderboard](leaderboard.md). 

In the case of a tie among the top entries in terms of F-1 score up to a small constant (left to the discretion of Lightricks), we will subjectively evaluate the team's works in terms of training methodology, feature engineering, model interpretability and overall impression.  We reserve the right to split the total prize of ILS 6000 and award it to more than one team, based on our subjective evaluation.
