# Lightricks DataHack 2018 Challenge

Want to help a succesful Jerusalem startup pilot its churn prediction task for its flagship app?

Lightricks, the Jerusalem-based company behind popular, award-winning image and video
editing apps, invites **you** on board at DataHack. Sift through our application usage data to solve a pressing
business challenge for Facetune 2 (the hit selfie editor downloaded by millions of users
worldwide). 

With help from Lighricks mentors, search through the noisy data, consisting of tens of
thousands of users’ usage-records, to discover patterns that can predict who are the minority users who are going to churn!

The prize… a real-world, complex mission you can get your teeth into (with some sequence / time-series modeling), and a
lucrative cash reward too!

To submit your churn predictions on the test data for grading and listing in the leaderboard, please mail the output of your model (see [notebook](datahack_2018.ipynb) for example of how to create one) to **datahack@lightricks.com**. Please put your team's name in the Subject line.
